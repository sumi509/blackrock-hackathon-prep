# BlackRock Hackathon Preparation 

This repository documents my preparation for **BlackRock Hacking India 2026**.

The goal is not just solving DSA problems, but building skills required for real-world financial engineering:

* Data validation
* Transaction reconciliation
* Log parsing
* Time-window anomaly detection
* Portfolio balancing logic
